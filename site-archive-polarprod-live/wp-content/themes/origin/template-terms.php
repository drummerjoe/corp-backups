    <p><strong>1. Access and Use of the Drum Platform</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Drum Platform: </strong>The Drum Platform provides a marketplace where businesses seeking an independent sales or work force or new sales or engagement channels (“Business”) can leverage the services of individual professionals (“Drummer(s)”) who can help sell, promote, and market various products, services, or other engagements offered by the Businesses (“Offers”) to third-party customers or partners (“Buyer”). Businesses, Drummers, and Buyers are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and each User shall create a User account that enables access to the Drum Platform.</p>

    <p><strong>Scope of Drum Services: </strong>Drum provides the Drum Platform to connect Businesses and Drummers. Drum is not responsible for the ultimate sale of any products and services to Buyers or engagement with Buyers. As the provider of the Drum Platform, Drum does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Offers. Businesses alone are responsible for the Offers. Drummers should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to promote a particular Offer and communicate and interact with other Users, whether in person or online. Drum is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Users, and Drum will not mediate, arbitrate, or otherwise be involved with any disputes between Users unless Drum determines otherwise in its own discretion. Drum is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any User, nor is Drum responsible for the actions or omissions of any User, or your interactions with other users through the Drum Platform. Drum will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.</p>

    <p><strong>Your Registration Obligations: </strong>You may be required to register with Drum in order to access and use certain features of the Drum Platform.

    <p>There is no additional charge for the Text Service, but your mobile carrier’s standard message and data rates apply to any messages you send or receive through the Text Service, including confirmations and subsequent texts. Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain mobile features and certain mobile features may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device.

    <p>Furthermore, you represent and warrant that (i) you have read the terms of any agreements you have entered with any third parties in relation to your Offer, such as any event space, vendor, supplier, or other relevant third parties, and (ii) any Offer you post and a Drummer’s promotion and Buyer’s use or participation in the product or service offered in such Offer will not breach any such agreements.

    <p><strong>13. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>A. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>

    <p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Drum, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Drum Platform, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Drum are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

    <p><strong>B. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong></p>

    <p><em><strong>YOU AND DRUM AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND DRUM AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</strong></em></p>

    <p><strong>C. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

    <p>Drum is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at help@drum.io. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Drum should be sent to 756 W Peachtree St, 4th Floor, Atlanta, GA 30308 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Drum and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Drum may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Drum or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Drum is entitled.</p>

    <p><strong>D. Arbitration Procedures</strong></p>

    <p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a class="text-primary" title="" href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.adr.org</a>. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, <a class="text-primary" title="" href="http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.</a> If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>

    <p>Unless Drum and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Drum agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>

    <p><strong>E. Costs of Arbitration</strong></p>

    <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Drum will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Drum will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Drum will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>

    <p><strong>F. Confidentiality</strong></p>

    <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>

    <p><strong>G. Severability</strong></p>

    <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p>

    <p><strong>H. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>

    <p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Drum agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Drum Platform, you may reject any such change by sending Drum written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>

    <p><strong>14. Termination</strong></p>

    <p>You agree that Drum, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Drum Platform and remove and discard any content within the Drum Platform, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Drum believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Drum Platform, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Drum may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Drum Platform, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Drum Platform under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Drum may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Drum Platform. Further, you agree that Drum will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Drum Platform.</p>

    <p><strong>15. General</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Drum and govern your use of the Drum Platform, superseding any prior agreements between you and Drum with respect to the Drum Platform. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Drum agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Fulton County, GA. The failure of Drum to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Drum Platform or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Drum, but Drum may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Drum Platform may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Drum Platform.</p>
